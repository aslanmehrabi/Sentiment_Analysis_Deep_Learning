# Sentiment_Analysis_Deep_Learning
Sentiment analysis of a collection reviews of IMDB users by Deep Learning, SVM &amp; Bayse

Goal: prediction of user's opinion based on her comments
Data: 100000 reviews of IMDB
50000 labeled data
50000 unlabeled data
Unlabeled data has been used in the training phase of CNN

Feature extraction method:
 - Bag of words
 - word2vec
 
 feature Reduction method:
 - Chi2
 
 Deep Learning Methods:
 - LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
 - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
 Other Learning methods:
 - Linear SVM (Suppor Vector Machine)
 - Multinomial Naive Bayes
 
 Libraries (Usage):
 Numpy (Matrix operations)
 NLTK (NLP)
 Beautiful soup (preprocessing - Removing HTML tags)
 Scikit Learning(Machine Learning)
 Gensim (word2vec)
 Keras (Deep Learning)
